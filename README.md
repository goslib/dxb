# MongoDB Helper for Golang

<!-- > 2019-11-29T13:53:40+0800 -->

Somehow a shared package of MongoDB helper is needed
*personally(there may be better solutions)*,
to reduce the duplications.

## Possible Solutions

### Shared Package `Current`

Currently selected.

### Use Duplicated Packages

Not good.

### Duplicated Codes across Projects

Not good.
